The data will be extracted to an excel file in this folder. You can set the excel name in the json file i.e "week.json"
You can set the intervals in the same json file. 

if you set it as 300-305, it will cover 300,301,302,303,304... i.e range(i,n). It'll cover i to (n-1).

The chromedriver in this folder needs to be the same version as your current chrome version. I've already downloaded it.
Incase you update you chrome, download the driver from here (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
